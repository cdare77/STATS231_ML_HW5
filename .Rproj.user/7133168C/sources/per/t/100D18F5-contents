## Question 1

Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

*Supervised learning is any kind of statistical learning on training data that has has labeled output data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is any sort of statistical learning done on training data that lacks any sort of labeled input and output (training) data.*



## Question 2
Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.

*A regression model in the context of statistical learning is any sort of algorithm which assumes the output variables are continuous. A classification model, on the other hand, is used to predict discrete output values*

## Question 3
Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.

*For regression problems, mean squared error and mean absolute error a common metrics. For classification problems, error rate and area under ROC curve are common metrics*

## Question 4
As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.

* Descriptive models: *Models which best visually emphasize a trend in data*
* Inferential models: *Models which test relationships between the outcome and predictors*
* Predictive models: *Models which aim to predict the response / output with minimum reducible error*

## Question 5
Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

* Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar? 

*Mechanistic models are ones which rely on conceptual models of a system to predict the response. Empirically-driven models, on the other hand, are models that are focused on describing / fitting the data. The main difference then in this case is the existence of an assumption on the relationship between the predictors and outcome. One similarity I suppose is that they can both be overfitted*

* In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

*Probably a mechanistic model since you are already anticipating that the predictors and outcomes are related in some given way, and thus you are trying to find the error in the data instead of the underlying relationship.*

* Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.

*Since mechanistic models are based off underlying assumptions about the data, they typically have a low bias; however, for more complex systems they can still have high variance. One the other hand, sicne empirically-driven models are built purely off the data they typically have lower variance; however, they may have more bias since they may not capture all the relevant features of the data.*

## Question 6
A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

* Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

* How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.

*The first question (how likely is it that they will vote in favor) is predictive in nature since we are trying to predict the outcome / response based off given data. The second, however, is inferential since we are trying to test whether there is any sort of relationship between voter outcome and meeting the candidate.*


# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r eval = TRUE}
mpg
```

## Exercise 1
We are interested in highway miles per gallon, or the hwy variable. Create a histogram of this variable. Describe what you see/learn.


```{r include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy))+
  geom_histogram(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue")
```

*We can see from the graph that the vast majority of cars have 26 highway miles per gallon or less, with 26 miles per gallon the most common value.*


## Exercise 2 
Create a scatterplot. Put hwy on the x-axis and cty on the y-axis. Describe what you notice. Is there a relationship between hwy and cty? What does this mean?

```{r include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=cty)) + geom_point()
```

*We can see from the graph that there is a strong direct relationship between city miles per gallon and highway miles per gallon. This means that almost all cars will have a lower city miles per gallon than highway miles per gallon, but the exact difference follows a linear relationship. *


## Exercise 3
Make a bar plot of manufacturer. Flip it so that the manufacturers are on the y-axis. Order the bars by height. Which manufacturer produced the most cars? Which produced the least?

```{r include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x= fct_rev(fct_infreq(manufacturer)) ) ) + geom_bar() + labs(x = "manufacturer") + coord_flip()
```

*Dodge produced the most, Lincoln produced the least*


## Exercise 4
Make a box plot of hwy, grouped by cyl. Use geom_jitter() and the alpha argument to add points to the plot.

Describe what you see. Is there a relationship between hwy and cyl? What do you notice?

```{r include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x= factor(cyl), y=hwy ) ) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(alpha=0.3) 
```

*Yes there seems to be a loose relationship between highway miles per gallon and the number of cylinders. Specifically, the fewer the number of cylinders the better the miles per gallon*

## Exercise 5
Use the corrplot package to make a lower triangle correlation matrix of the mpg dataset. (Hint: You can find information on the package here.)

Which variables are positively or negatively correlated with which others? Do these relationships make sense to you? Are there any that surprise you?

```{r include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
 mpg %>% 
 select(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = 'lower', diag = FALSE, 
           method = 'color')
```

*displ and both cty/hwy are strongly inversely correlated, which makes sense as displ measures the engine displacement. Since engine displacement directly affects the amount of fuel being consumed, it makes sense that more fuel consumption means fewer miles per gallon* 

*There is also a strong positive relationship between hwy and cty, as described in exercise 2.*

*Lastly, there is a strong direct relationship between displ and cyl which makes sense, as more cylinders implies higher fuel consumption.*


## Exercise 6

USing ggplot(), recreate the following graphic as closely as you can. Hint: Use the ggthemes package.

```{r include = TRUE, message=FALSE}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x= hwy, y=factor(class) ) ) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(alpha=0.2) + labs(x = "Highway MPG", y= "Vehicle Class")
```

## Exercise 7

Recreate the following graphic.

```{r include = TRUE, message=FALSE}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x= factor(class), y= hwy, fill=drv) ) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "class", y= "hwy")
```


## Exercise 8

Recreate the following graphic.

```{r include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

 ggplot(mpg, aes(x= displ, y= hwy, color=drv) ) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE, aes(linetype = drv) ) + scale_linetype_manual(values = c("solid","dotted","dashed"))
```
